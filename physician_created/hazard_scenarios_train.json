Been fighting a bug since yesterday\u2014kind of shivery-hot, can\u2019t keep anything down, even the morning tabs came right back up. Feel weirdly wiped out, like standing makes my vision go fuzzy and my legs jelly. Heart\u2019s racing but also kind of slow? Hard to think straight. I finished my last \u2018rescue\u2019 tablets a while ago. Should I just sleep it off or is this a \u2018call someone now\u2019 situation?",

Brief light sensitivity can occur with viral colds or fatigue. No severe headache, vomiting, confusion, or rash makes bacterial meningitis unlikely.
